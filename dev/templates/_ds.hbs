            <p>Deutschland spricht</p>
            <p>
            Me and my former colleagues Andreas Loos and Michael Schultheiss technically implemented a political dating platform for news webpage <a class="underlined-link underlined-link--black" href="https://www.zeit.de/index" target="_blank">ZEIT ONLINE</a> that allowed people with opposing political views to meet in their neighbourhood for political discussions. 
            </p>
            By developing a lightweight web application, based on a form, a spreadsheet and a bunch of python scripts for matching participants, 12.000 readers could register for this social experiment and talk in real-life.</p>
            <p>In a pop-up survey embedded into articles on ZEIT ONLINE readers were asked to give their opinion on controversial political subjects such as migration, social inequality and environmental protection. On completion, they were offered to meet up with someone who lives close by and answered the questions in a completely different way. To take part, participants had to provide a valid mobile phone number and their postal code.</p>
            <p>The concept for Deutschland spricht comes from journalists Christian Bangel, Maria Exner, Philip Faigle and Jochen Wegner.</p>
