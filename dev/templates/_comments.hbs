            <p>Comments / PostgreSQL / Kubernetes Cluster</p>
            <p>A lightweight, flexible and scalable comments database for news website <a class="underlined-link underlined-link--black" href="https://www.zeit.de/index" target="_blank">ZEIT ONLINE</a> that stores more than 10.000 new comments each day. The database is based on PostgreSQL and orchestrated with Kubernetes in the Google Cloud.</p>
            <p>As a product owner I was responsible for setting up an agile development process together with my colleague Thomas Strothjohann and for defining the databaseâ€™s qualities in user stories.</p>
            <p>Thanks to a sophisticated data sync between the old database and the new one, we were able to switch systems during live operation without any downtime.</p>
